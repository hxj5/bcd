# Model architecture of evaluation 


## Module `extract`
Extract *cell x gene* CNA expression or probability matrices from each tool's
output, and save them into `.h5ad` files containing `anndata.AnnData` (adata)
objects.
The adata object should has at least one column "cell" in its ".obs", and at
least one column "gene" in its ".var".


## Module `overlap`
Get the overlapping (here, intersected) cells and genes of all tools and then
subset the adata objects.


## Module `annotate`
Update the adata objects by adding cell annotations and gene annotations into
its ".obs" and ".var", respectively.


## Module `truth`
Format the input ground truth table into *cell x gene* binary matrix, stored
in an adata object, with same dimensions of the adata objects outputted by 
module `annotate`.


## Module `roc`
Calculate metrics `roc` (Receiver Operating Characteristic), to evaluate the 
performance of each tool.


## Module `prc`
Calculate metrics `prc` (Precision Recall Curve), to evaluate the performance
of each tool.
Its structure should be similar to `roc`.


## Module `utils`
Helper functions in several sub-modules.
